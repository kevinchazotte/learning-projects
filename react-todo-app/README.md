# To-Do App

This is a basic to-do list app that utilizes TypeScript, React, and Redux. It supports adding and toggling of basic task objects that provide string names and descriptions with an input date, and categorizes tasks according to completeness and due-date. Redux is used for state management and supports two types of actions: adding a task and toggling a task's status.
